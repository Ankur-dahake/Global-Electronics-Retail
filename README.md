# Global-Electronics-Retail

#Background


Global Electronics is a local retail store based in the United States that specializes in sales of all electronic products. Their catalogue ranges from the sales of Audio devices, Computers, Home Appliances, Cell Phones, Cameras and Camcorders, Games, Toys, TV and Videos.

With the rapid growth and expansion of the company, their database of customers and products increases. This has lead to a need for Global Electronics to monitor their marketing performance and make more improved data-driven decisions.

Due to the current situation, Global Electronics has given us access to their main database which includes tables containing information about transactions, products, customers, stores and currency exchange rates from 2016 to 2021.

Task Requirement
Stakeholders at Global electronics have presented us with business requirements and insights to be derived from the database to guide their next marketing decisions. The requirements are:

* Overview of customers demographics and stores.
*Top products and the types of products sold.
* Seasonal patterns or trends for order volume and revenue?
* Average delivery time in days and if their are changes over time?
* Average order value (AOV) for online vs. in-store sales, is there any difference?
* Profit, Production Cost and Revenue over time.
